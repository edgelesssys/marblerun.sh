### Keep using your existing tools

Despite using the latest confidential-computing tech, Marblerun works frictionless with [K8s](https://kubernetes.io/), [Helm](https://helm.sh/) and normal services meshes like [Istio](https://istio.io/) or [Linkerd](https://linkerd.io/).

### Cloud native and cloud agnostic

Marblerun is written in Go and uses standards like gRPC and REST. It scales and secures your apps in any cloud that has Intel SGX - like [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/confidential-compute/).
