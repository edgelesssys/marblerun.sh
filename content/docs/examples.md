# Examples

## Hello world

We have two basic examples of how to build confidential applications with Marblerun.

* See [helloworld](https://github.com/edgelesssys/marblerun/blob/master/samples/helloworld) for how to integrate Marblerun with your Golang application.

The popular [Linkerd](https://linkerd.io) service mesh uses the simple and fun scalable *emojivoto* app as the default demo. You can find our confidential variant [on GitHub](https://github.com/edgelesssys/emojivoto). Your emoji votes have never been safer!
