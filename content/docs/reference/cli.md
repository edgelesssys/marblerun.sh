# Command Line Interface (CLI)

We provide a command-line interface (CLI) for Marblerun.
This CLI allows you to install Marblerun on your cluster and interacts with the control plane through the Client API for all administrative tasks in the service mesh.

## Installation

To install the Marblerun CLI on your machine you can use our pre-built binaries.

**For the current user**

```bash
wget -P ~/.local/bin https://github.com/edgelesssys/marblerun/releases/latest/download/marblerun
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/marblerun
```

## Command `completion`
Generate a shell script to enable autocompletion for `marblerun` commands.
Supported shells are:
* `bash`:
  * To enable completion run:
    ```bash
    source <(marblerun completion bash)
    ```

* `zsh`:
  * If completion is not already enabled you need to enable it first:
    ```bash
    echo "autoload -U compinit; compinit" >> ~/.zshrc
    ```
  * Enable completion for `marblerun`:
    ```bash
    marblerun completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_marblerun"
    ```


Once enabled, command completion is just one keypress away:\
  `marblerun ma`+<kbd>Tab</kbd> completes to:\
  `marblerun manifest`


## Command `graphene-prepare`
This command helps you if you want to add Graphene-based services to your Marblerun service mesh.
It prepares your Graphene project to be used as a Marble by replacing the original entrypoint of your application with the bootstrapping Marble premain process which eventually spawns your application.
Given your [Graphene manifest template](https://graphene.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manifest-syntax.html), it will suggest the required adjustments needed and adds our bootstrapping data-plane code to your Graphene image.
See [Building a service: Graphene]({{< ref "docs/building-services/graphene.md" >}}) for detailed information on Marblerunâ€™s Graphene integration and our changes in your Graphene manifest.

Please note that this only works on a best-effort basis and may not instantly work correctly.
While suggestions should be made for every valid TOML Graphene configuration, changes can only be performed for non-hierarchically sorted configurations. as the official Graphene examples.
The unmodified manifest is saved as a backup under the old path with an added ".bak" suffix, allowing you to try out and roll back any changes performed.

Remember, you need to create a [Marblerun manifest]({{< ref "docs/workflows/define-manifest.md" >}}) in addition to the Graphene manifest. Adding Graphene packages to your manifest is straightforward and follows the same principles as any other SGX enclave. If you configured the arguments to your Graphene application through the [Graphene manifest](https://graphene.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manifest-syntax.html#command-line-arguments) before, you need to transfer those to the [Marblerun manifest]({{< ref "docs/workflows/define-manifest.md#manifestmarbles">}}).

  **Usage**

  ```bash
  marblerun graphene-prepare <path>
  ```

  **Examples**
  ```bash
  marblerun graphene-prepare nginx.manifest.template
  ```

  Output:
  ```bash
  Reading file: nginx.manifest.template

  Marblerun suggests the following changes to your Graphene manifest:
  libos.entrypoint = "file:premain-graphene"
  loader.argv0_override = "$(INSTALL_DIR)/sbin/nginx"
  loader.insecure__use_host_env = 1
  sgx.allowed_files.marblerun_uuid = "file:uuid"
  sgx.enclave_size = "1024M"
  sgx.remote_attestation = 1
  sgx.thread_num = 16
  sgx.trusted_files.marblerun_premain = "file:premain-graphene"
  Do you want to automatically apply the suggested changes [y/n]? y
  Applying changes...
  Saving original manifest as nginx.manifest.template.bak...
  Saving changes to nginx.manifest.template...
  Downloading Marblerun premain from GitHub...
  Successfully downloaded premain-graphene.

  Done! You should be good to go for Marblerun!
  ```

## Command `install`

Install Marblerun on your Kubernetes cluster.
This command will add Marblerun to your local helm repository if it is not present yet, optionally you can provide a path to your own helm chart.

**Usage**

```bash
marblerun install [flags]
```

  Manifest written to: manifest-signature.json
  ```

* ### `signature`

  Print the signature of a Marblerun manifest.
  The manifest can be in either json or yaml format.

  **Usage**

  ```bash
  marblerun manifest signature manifest.json
  ```

  The output is the sha256 hash in base64 encoding of the manifest as it would be interpreted by the Marblerun coordinator.
  Note, that Internally, the coordinator handles the manifest in JSON format. Hence, the signature is always based on the JSON format of your manifest.
  You can quickly verify the integrity of the installed manifest by comparing the output of `marblerun manifest signature` on your local version and the signature returned by `marblerun manifest get` of the coordinator's version.

## Command `namespace`

Add namespaces to Marblerun.
If the auto-injection feature is enabled. All new pods in those namespaces will get their Marblerun configuration automatically injected.

* ### `add`

## Command `precheck`

  Check if your Kubernetes cluster supports SGX.
  More precisely the command will check if any nodes in the cluster define SGX resources through the use of [Device Plugins](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/compute-storage-net/device-plugins/).
  Currently supported are:
  * [Intel SGX Device Plugin](https://intel.github.io/intel-device-plugins-for-kubernetes/cmd/sgx_plugin/README.html), exposing the resources:
    * `sgx.intel.com/enclave`
    * `sgx.intel.com/epc`
    * `sgx.intel.com/provision`


  * [Azure SGX Device Plugin](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/confidential-computing/confidential-nodes-aks-overview#azure-device-plugin-for-intel-sgx-), exposing the resource:
    * `kubernetes.azure.com/sgx_epc_mem_in_MiB`

  **Usage**

  ```bash
  marblerun precheck
  ```

  * If your cluster does not support SGX the output is the following:

* ### `set`

  Sets one or more secrets for the coordinator. Requires credentials in the form of a private key and a self-signed certificate of the corresponding public key. The corresponding user needs to be permitted to access the requested secrets.
  Secrets to set are specified in a special secrets file in JSON format, or created by the CLI from a PEM encoded certificate and key.
